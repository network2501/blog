      <description>A while back I was dealing with QoS topics on an almost daily basis. A big thanks to NetContractor for this table but it needed some tweaks.
Change requirements;
 Larger QoS range Column for product reference Scalable printing size  Sadly WordPress doesn&amp;rsquo;t support SVG files natively so a jpg preview will have to make do. Download the friendly A3 pdf here or grab the excel file here to customise your own QoS calculator.</description>

      <title>Alternative to right click paste</title>

      <description>Before computers were the norm people would literally cut out articles they wanted and paste them onto paper. For the newer generations this must sounds archaic but my first face swap was in grade 1 cutting out peoples faces from magazines and pasting them onto my own crayon drawn stick figures.
For years I&amp;rsquo;d used teraterm or putty and later settled on SecureCRT as my terminal application of choice. Right click was my default method for pasting until a colleague accidentally misclicked and was stung by a copied line of &amp;ldquo;reload&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>The SRX is a stateful firewall but I want to use the vSRX as a router for study. I intend to configure IPv6, MPLS and ISIS so a few changes need to be made.
set security forwarding-options family inet6 mode packet-based set security forwarding-options family mpls mode packet-based set security forwarding-options family iso mode packet-based If the above wasn&amp;rsquo;t configured even with all the security configuration remove the stateful process of the firewall would drop traffic.</description>
