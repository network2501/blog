      <description>This site currently uses the Hyde-X theme with some modifcations. After dabbling with CSS here&amp;rsquo;s a few changes I made to suit my wants and needs.
 Sidebar and content background same colour Custom colour scheme highlightjs Gruvbox colour scheme Categories and Tags navigation pages (with links in side bar) Round avatar Reduce hight of post listing on main page  All these changes were organic as I learnt more about Hugo and CSS but I wanted to save the theme from my own mistakes.</description>

      <description>The decision to move away from Wordpress was easy. It cost too much and the writing interface got in the way. Queue the discovery of static site generators. Hugo did what I needed and AWS S3 meant I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to run a server.
So what is Hugo?
 Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go.
 The biggest selling point for me was Hugo is single blob with no external dependencies.</description>
