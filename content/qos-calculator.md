May 11, 2014 Â· [Comments][1] [qos][2]

A while back I was dealing with QoS topics on an almost daily basis. A big thanks to NetContractor for [this][3] table but it needed some tweaks.

Change requirements;

* Larger QoS range
* Column for product reference
* Scalable printing size

Sadly WordPress doesn't support SVG files natively so a jpg preview will have to make do. Download the friendly A3 pdf [here][4] or grab the excel file [here][5] to customise your own QoS calculator.
